## Description
Ever seen the iconic "Anchovies" scene in the very first spongebob empisode? Here it is in TTT2!

## How to Use
- Use the weapon to shoot a bus full of anchovies and try to run over as many opponents as possible.
- All players who got run over by the bus will be targeted by the anchovies first
- After all of those players are hit, they will start searching for more players, if they didn´t already deal thier max hits.

## ConVars
*You can change the ConVars in the F1 menu!*
